## [3.0.0](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v2.2.1...v3.0.0) - [April 13th 2020]

Major release. Switched from flow to TypeScript.

### Changed

- All API calls now use single structured argument instead of long list of partial arguments.
  (For the overview see `src/Ada.ts` changes in https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/61)
- `AddressTypeNibble` enum renamed to `AddressType`
- `derive/showAddress` now take `network` as an explicit parameter instead of `networkIdOrProtocolMagic` field in `AddressParams`
- all 64-bit integers that were previously stored in fields ending with `Str` (e.g. `feeStr`) are now without the suffix (i.e. `fee`) and take a "bignumber-like" argument which can be `Number` (if it is small enough, i.e. `<= Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`), string, or native `BigInt`. Non-native bigint implementations are not supported and should be converted to strings)
- all "tagged enums" now use `{type: SomeType.Variant, params: SomeTypeVariantParams}` typing. This unified previously mixed tagging with sometimes arbitrarily variant fields into the parent type. As part of this change
  - Relays are now typed properly with variants
  - TxOutput was separated into "amount" part (amount & tokenBundle) & `destination` specification.
    - Destination is now explicitly of type `DestinationType.ThirdParty` or `DestinationType.DeviceOwned` to clarify what the device should sign
    - Device owned destination reuses existing `Address` param type
  - `Address` is now tagged enum across different address types (Byron, Base, Enterprise, Pointer, Reward). Reward address still uses `spendingPath` instead of `stakingPath` to denote that this key can be used to spend funds
- All API call types now use `*Request`/`*Response` nomenclature
- GetVersion call now returns `{version, compatibility}` instead of `version` where `compatibility` describes overall set of features we support for the device. It should be responsibility of API users to check `compatibility.isCompatible` flag and urge users to upgrade device to `compatibility.recommendedVersion` if the device is not compatible.
- All (expected) errors thrown by the API are now descendants of `ErrorBase` from `errors` subpackage. API now distinguishes between these error types
  - `InvalidData` - you passed some wrong data to the API. We will not even try to communicate with the device
  - `DeviceUnsupported` - thrown when trying to use API with unsopported Ledger app version (or when using features not yet available for the app version)
  - `DeviceStatusError` - thrown when device rejects operation for some reason. Common reasons are found in `DeviceStatusCodes` mapping.
- There is new documentation available at (https://vacuumlabs.github.io/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/index.html)

### Removed

- Compatibility with pre-Mary (<2.2) App versions.

## [2.2.1](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1) - [February 18th 2021]

Patch release with a minor fix in signTransaction() call's parameters validation

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- relax the tokenBundle feature check to allow an empty array https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/pull/17

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0) - [February 8th 2021]

Works with Ledger Cardano app 2.2.0 and is backwards compatible with older versions down to 2.0.4/2.0.5\*. Older versions of this js library do not support Ledger Cardano app 2.2.0, hence an update to this version of the library is required before Ledger Cardano app 2.2.0 is released.

### Added

- Support for Allegra-era transaction min validity property, transaction TTL is now optional: https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/27/files
- Support for Mary-era multiasset outputs (no minting yet) https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/27/files
- Update docs with a stake pool registration (as an owner) example https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/23

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect validation of numerical parameters passed as strings which failed for values over JS max safe integer: https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/29

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/releases/tag/v2.1.0) - [December 11th 2020]

Works with Ledger Cardano app 2.1.0 and is backwards compatible with 2.0.4/2.0.5 as well\*. Older versions of this library do not support Ledger Cardano app 2.1.0, therefore an update to this version of the library is required before Ledger Cardano app 2.1.0 is released.

### Added

- Support for bulk public key export https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/13/files
- Support for stake pool registration certificate as a pool owner https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/12
- Docs for available calls https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/17

### Changed

- Allow transactions without outputs: https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/16
- Updated flow types for Certificates, [commit](https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/commit/c50d383fe65e0db1787bda39984423f165bf0316#diff-6e0ee7e0e42296aeb681e34e50808e744aeeeff03702bab5ab7994bb4e0562e3)

### Fixed

## [2.0.1] - [August 20th 2020]

### Added

- Certificate and address type Flow enums, [commit](https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/commit/df08b3fdb7383b1065e7ad971626430a126f98aa)

### Changed

### Fixed

## [2.0.0] - [August 18th 2020]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

\* _backwards compatibility refers only to features supported by the respective app versions, unsupported features result in an error being thrown._
